<strong>Conway's Game Of Life:</strong>
<br>The Game Of Life is a cellular automaton, devised by John Horton Conway in 1970.
<br><br>
<strong>Rules Of Life:</strong>
<br>1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
<br>2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
<br>3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
<br>4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
