<h2>Conway's Game Of Life</h2>
<p>The Game Of Life is a cellular automaton, devised by John Horton Conway in 1970.<br></p>

<h3>Rules Of Life:</h3>
<p>1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
<br>2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
<br>3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
<br>4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.<br></p>

<h3>Navigation:</h3>
<p><b>Left mouse button (clicked):</b>     <i> Inverts state of the clicked cell.</i><br>
<b>Left mouse button (hold):</b>     <i> Revives all hovered cells.</i><br>
<b>Right mouse button (clicked):</b>     <i> Kills the clicked cell. If no cell is clicked, the context menu will be shown.</i><br>
<b>Right mouse button (hold):</b>     <i> Kills all hovered cells.</i><br>
<b>Mouse wheel (clicked):</b>     <i> Shows context menu if a cell is clicked.</i><br>
<b>Mouse wheel (scrolled):</b>     <i> Moves the view if not the whole area can be shown.</i><br>
<b>[CTRL] + mouse wheel (scrolled):</b>     <i> Zoom (+/-)</i><br>
<b>Arrow keys:</b>     <i> Moves the view if not the whole area can be shown.</i><br>
<b>[CTRL] + [+]:</b>     <i> Zoom in</i><br>
<b>[CTRL] + [-]:</b>     <i> Zoom out</i>
